# Data Science Intern Assignment  

## Overview  
This project includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **business insights**, and **clustering analysis** on the given dataset.  

## **Project Structure**  
- `data/` → Contains the dataset used for analysis  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebooks with EDA and clustering code  
- `reports/` → PDF report with business insights  
- `scripts/` → Python scripts for data processing and clustering  

## **Tasks Covered**  
### **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Data cleaning, handling missing values  
- Visualization of customer distribution and trends  
- Business insights from trends  

### **Task 2: Business Insights**  
- **Customer spending distribution** (Right-skewed spending pattern)  
- **Seasonal revenue trends** (Peaks in July & September)  
- **Brand performance analysis** (TechPro dominates sales)  

### **Task 3: Clustering Analysis**  
- Used **K-Means clustering**  
- **Optimal Clusters:** **4** (based on the elbow method)  
- **Davies-Bouldin Index:** **1.2262** (lower is better)  
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Clusters are **well-separated** but with some overlap  
  - Different **shapes & densities** indicate varying customer segments  

## **Installation & Setup**  
1. Clone the repository:
